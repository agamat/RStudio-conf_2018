CRAN: The Home of Hidden Treasures
========================================================

12,000 + Packages

GitHub is gaining ground
=========================================================
METACRAN

How many CRAN Packages are valuable?
========================================================
![](taskviews.png)   

***   

At least about 1/4!
* 35 Task Views
* All curated by experts
* Containing 2,960 packages 

After more than a year of looking at all new packages on CRAN each month I think that percentage of valuable packages is much higher!


CRAN == Statistical Knowledge
==============================================================
CRAN is the worlds largest most complete repository of statistical computing knowledge.

Types of R Packages
=========================================================
By application domain:
* Computational Methods
* Data
* Data Science
* Machine Learning
* Science 
* Statistics
* Utilities

***

By intended use:  
* Public  
* Private  
   + Personal   
   + Professional  

Professional Packages
=======================================================
e.g. [clindr](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=clinDR)   

![](clindr.png)   

***

* References behind paywall
* No vignette
* No README
* Looks like quite a bit of work went into it
   * Numerous functions
   * Parallel execution


Good R Packages:
========================================================
* Do something that people other than the author might consider useful   
* Offer enough functionality to make it worth remembering   
* Are well documented with both:   
   + Complete reference manuals that included references
   + README and NEWS files
   + Thoughtful vignettes   
* Work   
* Are well maintained   

The Best R Packages:
=========================================================
* Are well written, tested and provide helpful messages 
* Have champions who actively promote, explain and teach their use   
* Are likely curated by others (R Task Views)   
* Used by other developers   

Great R Packages:
=========================================================
* Add new functionality and capabilities    
* Develop new infrastructure   
* Improve performance    
* Change the way people think about R   
* Expand the reach of R  
* Do something beautiful

Some Simple Package Stats
========================================================

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ss <- function(x){
   avg <- round(mean(x),digits=2)
   std <- round(sd(x),digits=2)
   med <- median(x)
   res <- list(mean = avg, sd = std, median = med)
}
load("pkg_counts_v2.RDA")
dim(pkg_counts)
sapply(pkg_counts[-1],ss)
```  

```{r,eval=FALSE}
# pdb <- tools:::CRAN_package_db()
load("pdbjan31.RDA")
```



Reverse Depends and Imports Stats
=========================================================
RDRI quantiles
```{r, echo = FALSE}
quantile(pkg_counts$RDRI)
```  

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=20,fig.height=10}
library(ggplot2)
p <- ggplot(pkg_counts, aes(RDRI))
p + geom_histogram() + xlim(0,50) + ylim(0,500) + 
     theme(axis.text=element_text(size=30),
        axis.title=element_text(size=30,face="bold"))
```

p1 + geom_histogram(bins=25) + xlim(0,10) + 
     theme(axis.text=element_text(size=30),
        axis.title=element_text(size=30,face="bold"))
```

Parting Thoughts
========================================================
When writing an R package:
* Think about being kind to your users
* Put effort into the documentation
* Think about collaborating
* Know that you are making a direct contribution to statistical knowledge
